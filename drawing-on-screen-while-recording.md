Excerpts:
" Before you start your recording session with the Camtasia Windows Recorder, select Tools > Recording Toolbar > Effects Toolbar, and then hit Record. Once the recording session is on the way you will see the Effects Toolbar on the Recorder panel. Click on the ScreenDraw button and the several different options will appear on the toolbar."

"You can draw arrows, circles, rectangles or eclipses, while you can also choose the pen tool if you would like to write or draw something. The ScreenDraw feature enables you to select the color of your drawings, while you can also set the size of the visual content you are adding by adjusting the width option. If for some reason you didn't like your illustration, press ctrl+z to undo the last action. All drawings created during the recording session are burned into the video and they can not be changed or removed after the session is over."

- If you want to draw lines while recording on your Windows PC, you can use the  ScreenDraw by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+D at recording.

-  I believe that while recording, you are able to press Ctrl+M during that recording process to add a marker. So you would likely do well to use this keypress during your recording process to insert a marker where you want one of these arrows or other objects. Then, after you record and you open the editor, you could use the marker to quickly find where you want the object. And you could then insert the desired object on top of the video.
